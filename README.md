# rotmg-deca-27.7
This isn't my work. Only used what has been made publically available to make a buildable project.

Some of the libraries have been updated from the ones used in the original client. There will likely be errors I didn't catch because of this.

# About

This repo is intended to be a reference point from which other projects can build from. No new features/changes will be made that stray from the original client. If bugs crop up that seem localized to this release, please open up an issue about it and it will be fixed.
